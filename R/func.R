object is the baby
func is the mom
object<-function()
to run a func
function.name(data you want func to operate on)
to round-round number in parathesis
> round(2,4721)
[1] 2
use mean func for mean
 mean(1:10)
[1] 5.5
> mean(a)
[1] 5.5
what we pass in func is called argument
passing data for example
data can be raw data
our 1:10 case
or object
like a or bob
or result of other func
round(mean(a))
[1] 6
save round result as b
 b<-round(mean(a))
> print(b)
[1] 6
