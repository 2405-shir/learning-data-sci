vec and vic have same length
3 values 
vec 3 values match perfectly with vic 3 values
but this isnt always case
vector recycling
basically you repeat the shorter vector till 2 vector equal in length
then and only then r carries out operation
 so if you have one vector from 1 to 10
 and other vector from 1 to 5
 then r will start attaching numbers from one to 5
 to the end of the shorter vector
 effictively making it a vector storing seq 12345 12345
